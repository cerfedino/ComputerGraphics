//------------ Assignment ----------------
// Add vertices for the cube as well as colors for corresponding vertices.
// Remember that:
// (1) The vertices for each triangle has to be provided in a counter-clockwise order to make the face culling work properly. If the order of vertices won't be correct the triangles won't be visible.
// (2) The current coordinate system has: x-axis pointing right, y-axis pointing up, and z-axis pointing towards the screen
// (3) Everything which is within [-1..1]x[-1..1]x[-1..1] volume will be projected onto the screen along z-axis
//-----------------------------------------

//var cube_vertices = [...];
//var cube_colors = [...];
